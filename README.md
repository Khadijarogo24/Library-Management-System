## Library Management System (Beginner Python Project)

 Project Description

This is a simple **Library Management System** built with **Python** to help manage books and members in a small library. It demonstrates key programming concepts suitable for beginners such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, **loops**, **conditionals**, and **modules**.



 # Features

* ðŸ“¥ Add new books to the library
* ðŸ™‹ Register library members
* ðŸ“– Issue books to members
* ðŸ”„ Return borrowed books
* ðŸ’¾ Save records to a text file for future use



##  Concepts Used

| Concept           | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **OOP**           | Represent books and people as objects          |
| **File Handling** | Save and load data from a text file            |
| **Loops**         | Repeat menu options until the user exits       |
| **Conditionals**  | Make decisions based on user actions           |
| **Modules**       | Organize the project into smaller, clear files |
